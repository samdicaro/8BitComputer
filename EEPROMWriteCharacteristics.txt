Writing protocol will be carried out by an Arduino.
Write Options:
1. Single Byte Write
2. Page Write

Single Byte:
- OE must be held high
- Either WE or CE is held low while the other toggles from high to low back to high
- Important timing characteristics:
	* address must be available at least 50ns before write pulse and before data is latched in
	* either WE or CE must be low at least 50ns before write pulse
	* write pulse must last at least 100ns
	* data requires at least 50ns of setup time before write pulse ends
- data hold time is said to be 0ns

Page Write:
- OE must be held high
- CE and WE need to be toggled synchronously from high to low
- data is latched on the rising edge of write pulse
- Important timing characteristics:
	* address must be held until rising edge of write pulse for at least 50ns
	* data setup time is 50ns so it must be available 50ns before rising edge of write pulse
	* data has 150us to be loaded before next byte
	* write pulse width (low) must be at least 100ns and must be high for at least 50ns
- full page write cycle requires waiting 10ms before data is available for reading
