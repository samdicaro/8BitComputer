Fetch Stage:
- PC is sent through data bus to the MAR (1 clock cycle)
- MAR then reads SRAM and the word is sent through data bus to the IR (1 clock cycle)
- PC is incremented

Decode Stage:
- counter is changed on negative edge of clock cycle to compute the upper portion of ROM address
- lower portion of ROM address holds the opcode
- data must be decoded and ready for the next clock cycle

Execution Stage:
- each control word is sent to the components and a process is performed
- control instructions can span multiple clock cycles
Example: Different address (steps) for a 1100's operation. Each address is read from ROM and sent to the cpu components.
ROM has 13 address bits.
0_0000_0000_1100 or 0_0000_0100_1100 or
0_0000_0001_1100 or 0_0000_0101_1100 or
0_0000_0010_1100 or 0_0000_0110_1100 or
0_0000_0011_1100 or 0_0000_0111_1100
- each instruction will get its own 8 different steps and possibly unique control signals
- due to nature of fetch cycle, first few control words will be the same regardless of the opcode
