# 8BitComputer
This repository will hold all the updates to the 8BitComputer machine code and assembly code.
# Inspiration
This project was originally inspired by Ben Eater's 8 bit computer.
The overall layout of the hardware follows Ben's in order to save space. Everything else is my own.
The IC components, control word, and memory devices are not the same.
# Hardware
Most the ICs came from Texas Instruments CD74xx### family.
SRAM: 8192 words by 8 bits.
EEPROM: 8192 word by 8 bits.
# Future TODO
*Verilog description of the processor.
*Expand to 10 bits.
*Outline the instruction set.
*Perform (2x2) x (2x) matrix multiplication.
