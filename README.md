## Mission
* The goal of this project is to help improve my overall understanding of processor design.
* Track my progress on a physical project.
* Integrate hardware design with software design.
* Build a custom instruction set for programmable output.
## Inspiration
This project was originally inspired by Ben Eater's 8 bit computer: https://eater.net/8bit/ I have since deviated from his layout.
## Hardware
* Most the ICs came from Texas Instruments CD74xx### family.
* SRAM: 8192 words by 8 bits.
* EEPROM: 8192 word by 8 bits.
## TODO
* Verilog description of the processor.
* Expand hardware to 10 bits.
* Outline the instruction set.
* Perform (2x2) x (2x2) matrix multiplication.
